# 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder

- Utilizing the 180nm TSMC models for the MOSFETs, CMOS gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) were created to implement the RCA

circuit from the ground up. To test the circuit, simply open the project in LTspice, and it should be ready for use.

- Maybe add pictures ... if you're not lazy that is.
